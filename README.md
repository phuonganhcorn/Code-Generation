# Code-Generator

### 1. Overview

- The objective of this project is to construct a model for generating code snippets based on existing text generation models. **_What sets this model apart from others in the text generation domain is its primary focus on producing a high-quality dataset_**. While other models primarily concentrate on developing question-answering mechanisms, this model prioritizes the creation of a dataset with superior quality.
  
- The dataset generated from this project can be utilized for larger-scale projects such as building chatbots, reinforcement learning-based language models, and more.

### 2. Introduction
> [!NOTE]
> For this project, we are adopting the logic of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consists of two main components: the **Generator Model** and the **Discriminator Model, which also serves as the Ranking Model.**

# Code-Generator

### 1. Overview

- The objective of this project is to construct a model for generating code snippets based on existing text generation models. **_What sets this model apart from others in the text generation domain is its primary focus on producing a high-quality dataset with AI/ML model_**. While other models primarily concentrate on developing question-answering mechanisms, this model prioritizes the creation of a dataset with superior quality.
  
- The dataset generated from this project can be utilized for larger-scale projects such as building chatbots, reinforcement learning-based language models, and more.

### 2. Introduction
> [!NOTE]
> For this project, I'm adopting the logic of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consists of two main components: the _**Generator Model**_ and the _**Discriminator Model, which also serves as the Ranking Model.**_
